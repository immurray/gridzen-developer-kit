# cline · GridZen 0.4.0

Python 3.11+; installed GridZen kit. Six Skills and five public MCP tools.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade gridzen-developer-kit
gridzen setup --client cline --project .
gridzen setup --client cline --project . --apply
```

Windows activation: `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in PowerShell. If `venv` is
unavailable on Debian/Ubuntu, install `python3-venv` using the OS package manager.
Do not bypass the system Python protection. The first setup command previews;
`--apply` writes project-scoped files, merges the Gridzen server, backs up changed
config files and refuses different existing Gridzen entries or Skills. No accounts,
provider keys or model API credentials are installed.

MCP target: `gridzen-clients/cline/cline_mcp_settings.json`. Skill target: `.cline/skills`.

Open Cline MCP Servers → Configure and merge the generated Gridzen entry, or use Remote Servers with Streamable HTTP. The generated project file is a handoff template, not a claim that the extension automatically reads it. Skills are copied into .cline/skills.

Try: “Plan a non-production Mexico payout pilot, identify missing permissions and
evidence, then test a synthetic provider timeout. Do not authorize a real payment.”
Expected: draft or missing-information output; simulated=true, verified=false,
provider_calls=0. Timeouts, missing evidence and unsupported remain inconclusive.
Tool names are get_coverage, plan_verification, create_sandbox_verification,
get_sandbox_verification, explain_result.

Actual acceptance is recorded in [compatibility.json](../../clients/compatibility.json);
configuration tests are not a claim of model or graphical-client acceptance.
